🔍 DEBUG: WHY ARE ORDERS EMPTY?
================================

Let's figure out what's wrong step by step.

STEP 1: Check Firebase Console
================================
Open this link:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ecommerce-55491/firestore/data/~2Forders

QUESTION: Do you see ANY documents in the "orders" collection?

[ ] YES - I see order documents
[ ] NO - The orders collection is empty or doesn't exist

If NO → Go to STEP 2
If YES → Go to STEP 3


STEP 2: Create Orders (No data exists)
=======================================
Run this command to create sample orders:

npm run seed-data

This will:
- Find existing users
- Create 2-5 orders for each user
- Save them to Firestore

After running, check Firebase Console again.
Do you see orders now?

[ ] YES - Orders appeared! → Go to STEP 3
[ ] NO - Still empty → PASTE THE OUTPUT HERE


STEP 3: Check Indexes
======================
Open this link:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ecommerce-55491/firestore/indexes

QUESTION: What is the status of your indexes?

[ ] All are GREEN (Enabled)
[ ] Some are YELLOW (Building) - Wait 5 more minutes
[ ] Some are RED (Error) - Need to fix
[ ] No indexes exist - Need to deploy

If no indexes or errors, run:
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

Wait 5 minutes, then check again.


STEP 4: Check Browser Console
==============================
1. Open your app: http://localhost:5173/admin/orders
2. Press F12 to open developer tools
3. Click "Console" tab
4. Look for RED error messages

QUESTION: What errors do you see?

Copy and paste ANY red error messages here:
_____________________________________________


STEP 5: Check Network Requests
===============================
1. Keep F12 open
2. Click "Network" tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for requests to Firestore

QUESTION: Do you see any failed requests (red)?

[ ] YES - Which ones failed?
[ ] NO - All requests succeeded


STEP 6: Test Order Creation
============================
Let's test if you can CREATE an order:

1. Login as: john.doe@example.com / password123
2. Go to: http://localhost:5173/products
3. Add 2-3 items to cart
4. Go to checkout
5. Click "Place Order"

QUESTION: What happened?

[ ] Success message appeared
[ ] Error message appeared - What was the error?
[ ] Nothing happened
[ ] Page crashed


STEP 7: Check After Order Creation
===================================
After placing an order:

1. Check browser console (F12) - Any errors?
2. Check Firebase Console - Did order appear?
3. Go to /admin/orders - Does it show now?


QUICK DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS
==========================
Run these and tell me the output:

1. Check if Firebase CLI is logged in:
   firebase projects:list

2. Check current project:
   firebase use

3. Try to deploy indexes:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

4. Try to seed data:
   npm run seed-data


PASTE YOUR RESULTS HERE:
=========================

1. Firebase Console - Orders collection:
   [ ] Empty
   [ ] Has documents - How many? ____

2. Firebase Console - Indexes status:
   [ ] All enabled (green)
   [ ] Building (yellow)
   [ ] Error (red)
   [ ] Don't exist

3. Browser Console errors:
   (Paste any red errors here)


4. Network tab - Failed requests:
   (List any failed requests)


5. Seed data output:
   (Paste the output of npm run seed-data)


6. Index deployment output:
   (Paste the output of firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes)


MOST COMMON ISSUES:
===================

Issue 1: Indexes not deployed or still building
Solution: firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
         Wait 5 minutes

Issue 2: No data in Firestore
Solution: npm run seed-data

Issue 3: Security rules blocking access
Solution: firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

Issue 4: Not logged in as admin
Solution: Make sure you're logged in as barentohashum11@gmail.com


NEXT STEPS:
===========
Please fill out the questions above and let me know:
1. What you see in Firebase Console
2. What errors appear in browser console
3. What happens when you run the commands

This will help me identify the exact problem!
