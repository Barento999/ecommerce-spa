✅ DATA EXISTS! - FINAL STEPS TO SEE ORDERS
============================================

GREAT NEWS: You have 41 orders in Firestore!
✓ 5 users
✓ 41 orders

Now we just need to deploy indexes so the admin page can query them.


STEP 1: Deploy Indexes
=======================
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

Expected output: "Deploy complete!"


STEP 2: Wait for Indexes to Build
==================================
Wait 5 minutes for indexes to build.

Check status here:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ecommerce-55491/firestore/indexes

All indexes should be GREEN (Enabled)


STEP 3: Open Admin Orders Page
===============================
1. Make sure dev server is running:
   npm run dev

2. Open: http://localhost:5173/admin/orders

3. Login as admin: barentohashum11@gmail.com


STEP 4: Check Browser Console
==============================
If orders still don't show:

1. Press F12
2. Look for errors in Console tab
3. Check if there are "index required" errors

If you see index errors:
- Wait 5 more minutes for indexes to build
- Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R


STEP 5: Test Order Creation
============================
To test creating a new order:

1. Logout
2. Login as: john.doe@example.com / password123
3. Go to: http://localhost:5173/products
4. Add items to cart
5. Checkout and place order
6. Check if it appears in /admin/orders


WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE:
====================
In admin orders page:
- 41+ orders listed
- Filter by status works
- Search works
- Can click to view order details


IF STILL EMPTY:
===============
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Make sure indexes are all GREEN in Firebase Console
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
4. Try incognito mode
5. Check that you're logged in as admin


NEXT COMMAND TO RUN:

firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

Then wait 5 minutes and check the admin page!
