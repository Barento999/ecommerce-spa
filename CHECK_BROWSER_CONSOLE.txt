🔍 CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE FOR ERRORS
=====================================

I've added detailed logging to the orderService.

STEPS TO DEBUG:
===============

1. Open your app: http://localhost:5173/admin/orders

2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools

3. Click "Console" tab

4. Look for these messages:
   - "getAllOrders called with filters:"
   - "Building query with constraints:"
   - "Executing query..."
   - "Query returned X documents"
   - "Returning X orders"

5. Look for RED error messages


WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
=================

✓ GOOD - You should see:
   "getAllOrders called with filters: {status: 'all'}"
   "Building query with constraints: 2"
   "Executing query..."
   "Query returned 41 documents"
   "Returning 41 orders"

❌ BAD - If you see:
   "Error fetching all orders: FirebaseError..."
   "permission-denied"
   "index required"
   "Query returned 0 documents"


COMMON ERRORS:
==============

Error: "The query requires an index"
Solution: 
  - Check Firebase Console indexes
  - Make sure all are GREEN (Enabled)
  - Wait 5 more minutes if YELLOW (Building)

Error: "Permission denied"
Solution:
  - Make sure you're logged in
  - Check that you're logged in as admin
  - Run: cd functions && npm run create-admin

Error: "Query returned 0 documents"
Solution:
  - Check security rules are allowing read
  - Check that you're authenticated
  - Try logging out and back in


ALTERNATIVE TEST:
=================

Open this file in your browser:
file:///C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/pro/ecommerce-spa/TEST_ADMIN_ACCESS.html

This will test:
1. Login functionality
2. Fetching orders directly
3. Show detailed error messages


PASTE YOUR CONSOLE OUTPUT HERE:
================================

(Copy and paste what you see in the browser console)


NEXT STEPS:
===========

After checking console:
1. If you see "permission-denied" → Security rules issue
2. If you see "index required" → Indexes not ready
3. If you see "Query returned 0" → Query issue
4. If no errors but still empty → UI rendering issue

Let me know what you see in the console!
