🔧 FIX FOR EMPTY ORDERS PAGE
================================

PROBLEM: The seed script was skipping order creation for existing users.

SOLUTION: I've fixed the seed script. Now run these commands:

1. Run the fixed seed script:
   npm run seed-data

   This will now create orders for the existing users!

2. Deploy the indexes (if you haven't already):
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

3. Wait 2-5 minutes for indexes to build

4. Hard refresh your browser:
   - Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

5. Check the orders page again!

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- The seed script now creates orders even when users already exist
- It signs in as existing users to get their user IDs
- Then creates 2-5 orders for each user

EXPECTED RESULT:
- You should see 10-25 orders in the admin orders page
- Each of the 5 sample users will have 2-5 orders

TEST IT:
1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/admin/orders
2. You should see orders listed
3. Try filtering by status
4. Try searching by email

STILL EMPTY?
Check Firebase Console to verify orders were created:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ecommerce-55491/firestore/data/~2Forders

If you see orders in Firebase but not in the app:
- Wait for indexes to finish building (check Indexes tab)
- Hard refresh browser
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
