🚀 FIX PERMISSION DENIED - RUN THESE COMMANDS
==============================================

I've fixed the scripts to use Firebase Admin SDK which bypasses security rules.

RUN THESE COMMANDS IN ORDER:
=============================

1. Check what's in Firestore:
   npm run check-orders

2. Create sample orders:
   npm run seed-data

3. Check again to verify orders were created:
   npm run check-orders

4. Deploy indexes:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

5. Wait 5 minutes for indexes to build

6. Open your app and check admin orders page:
   http://localhost:5173/admin/orders


WHAT I FIXED:
=============
- Updated checkOrders.mjs to use Firebase Admin SDK
- Updated seedData.mjs to use Firebase Admin SDK
- Admin SDK bypasses security rules (has full access)
- Scripts now use serviceAccountKey.json for authentication


EXPECTED OUTPUT:
================

After "npm run check-orders":
✓ Found 5 users
✓ Found 10-25 orders

After "npm run seed-data":
✓ Created user profile for john.doe@example.com
✓ Created 3 orders for john.doe@example.com
(repeated for each user)


IF YOU GET ERRORS:
==================

Error: Cannot find module 'firebase-admin'
Solution: Already installed in devDependencies, should work

Error: Cannot find serviceAccountKey.json
Solution: Make sure serviceAccountKey.json is in the root folder

Error: Permission denied
Solution: Check that serviceAccountKey.json has correct credentials


START HERE:
===========
Run this command now:

npm run check-orders

This should now work and show you what's in Firestore!
